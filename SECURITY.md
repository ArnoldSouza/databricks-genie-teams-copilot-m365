# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, **do not** create a public issue. Instead, please email: **arnoldporto@gmail.com**.

Provide as much detail as possible:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Affected files/paths and version (`VERSION` file)
- Any suggested mitigations

I aim to acknowledge reports as soon as possible.

# Media asset guidelines

## Capture
- Prefer **1280×720** (16:9) or **1440×900**.
- Record **≤20s** per GIF; keep file sizes **<8MB** when possible.
- Hide secrets; use fake IDs for demos.

## Optimize
- Trim dead time; crop to the key UI area.
- Reduce frame rate (10–15 fps) if needed.
- Consider compressing GIFs with your preferred tool.

## Naming
- Use the prefilled placeholders in `docs/images/` and `docs/gifs/`.
- Keep `feature-XX-*` or `auto-deploy-XX-*` patterns for sorting.

## Accessibility
- Provide descriptive **alt text** and concise captions.
- Ensure important text remains legible after compression.
